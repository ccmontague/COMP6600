The following steps detail how to run the project files in Python.

Baseline Algorithm
1. Run preprocessing.py to format the data such that it can be used by the models.
2. Ensure that a Harry_Potter_Ready.txt file was created in the folder
3. Open the Baseline Algorithm and scroll down to the 
4. Set N equal to the number of words you would like to use as input
5. Run the Baseline_Final.py

LSTM Model
1. Run preprocessing.py to format the data such that it can be used by the models.
2. Ensure that a Harry_Potter_Ready.txt file was created in the folder
3. ...

Hidden Marcov Model (HMM) Algorithm
1. Run preprocessing.py to format the data such that it can be used by the models.
2. Ensure that a Harry_Potter_Ready.txt file was created in the folder
3. Run the HiddenMarcovModel_Final.py

N-Gram Marcov Model
1. Run preprocessing.py to format the data such that it can be used by the models.
2. Ensure that a Harry_Potter_Ready.txt file was created in the folder
3. Run N_Gram_Marcov.py
